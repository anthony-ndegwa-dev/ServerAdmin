JavaScript Server Admin

This app is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A user can create server to be listed in the left side-bar. On the
right side, jobs under particular server name are displayed in cards form with a delete button and checkbox on each card.
The number of uncompleted jobs is summed up on the header, a number that decreases everytime a new checkbox is checked.

Cards can be deleted on individual delete button or by deleting only complete task using button on top right of the main 
section.
